# Qiskit implementation of the Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewewnstein (EWL) protocol for executing the non-cooperative game Prisoner's Dilemma on a quantum computer

*Quantum game theory* studies how strategic interactions (non-cooperative games) can be improved upon when implemented on the emerging technology of quantum computers. 

## How to run

1. In Google Collab through pip install qiskit (provided in the Notebook). The IBM Q account token may be required. 
2. Or upload the notebook to the IBM Quntum Lab (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). No installations are required, simply import required frameworks.
